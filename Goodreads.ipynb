       "      <td>On 22 June 1941, Adolf Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Over 3,000,000 men, more than 3,000 tanks, and over 2,000 aircraft advanced east to begin National Socialism's crusade to destroy Bolshevism and carve out \"living space\" for the Thousand Year Reich. During the first few weeks of the invasion, the Germans achieved staggering results, as whole Soviet armies were annihilated, thousands of aircraft were destroyed on the ground, and hundreds of thousands of enemy soldiers were captured. Images of Barbarossa includes photographs of Operation Typhoon, the attempt by three panzer armies to capture Moscow. However, Soviet doggedness and one of the coldest Russian winters in living memory combined to stop the Germans at the gates of the Soviet capital, and in the process dashed any hopes of bringing the war on the Eastern Front to an end in 1942. Then, the Soviets unleashed a counter-attack along the front, under which the German armies buckled but managed to hold - just. Drawing on many previously unpublished images sourced from Russian archives, Christopher Ailsby recreates the experience of war on the Eastern Front in 1941: the choking dust and endless steppes of the Ukraine, the glutinous autumn and winter mud that made movement by wheeled and tracked vehicles all but impossible, and the numbing Russian Winter, which froze petrol and killed thousands of ill-equipped German soldiers. Away from the battlefield, Images of Barbarossa features the alrocities of the German SS and paramilitary units that followed the armies into the Soviet Union to implement the murderous racial policies of Nazism. Many of the images are haunting, and convey the horror and destructiveness of war on the Eastern Front.</td>\n",

       "2  On 22 June 1941, Adolf Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Over 3,000,000 men, more than 3,000 tanks, and over 2,000 aircraft advanced east to begin National Socialism's crusade to destroy Bolshevism and carve out \"living space\" for the Thousand Year Reich. During the first few weeks of the invasion, the Germans achieved staggering results, as whole Soviet armies were annihilated, thousands of aircraft were destroyed on the ground, and hundreds of thousands of enemy soldiers were captured. Images of Barbarossa includes photographs of Operation Typhoon, the attempt by three panzer armies to capture Moscow. However, Soviet doggedness and one of the coldest Russian winters in living memory combined to stop the Germans at the gates of the Soviet capital, and in the process dashed any hopes of bringing the war on the Eastern Front to an end in 1942. Then, the Soviets unleashed a counter-attack along the front, under which the German armies buckled but managed to hold - just. Drawing on many previously unpublished images sourced from Russian archives, Christopher Ailsby recreates the experience of war on the Eastern Front in 1941: the choking dust and endless steppes of the Ukraine, the glutinous autumn and winter mud that made movement by wheeled and tracked vehicles all but impossible, and the numbing Russian Winter, which froze petrol and killed thousands of ill-equipped German soldiers. Away from the battlefield, Images of Barbarossa features the alrocities of the German SS and paramilitary units that followed the armies into the Soviet Union to implement the murderous racial policies of Nazism. Many of the images are haunting, and convey the horror and destructiveness of war on the Eastern Front.   \n",

C'est un monde débordant de magie, un monde de contrastes et d'extrêmes qui va de la métropole grouillante d'Ankh-Morpork, la plus ancienne ville du Disque (aujourd'hui administrée d'une main de fer dans un gant de velours par le Patricien, le seigneur Vétérini), jusqu'au vieil empire du Klatch où il existe quinze mots différents pour désigner l'assassinat. Sans oublier le mystérieux continent XXXX - ou Quatricks, sur lequel rien de ce qu'on a entendu dire n'est vraiment exagéré -, le tout petit royaume de Lancre et l'Uberwald, un pays sinistre ou des bruits de collision retentissent dans la nuit. Et puis il y a les habitants. Les sorcières Mémé Ciredutemps, Nounou Ogg, Magrat Goussedail (aujourd'hui reine, bien entendu). Une pléthore de mages, comme l'archichancelier Mustrum Ridculle, le bibliothécaire, Rincevent, l'économe... Les moines de l'histoire et les vieilles familles de vampyres. De grands héros, tels Cohen le barbare et sa Horde d'Argent, Sam Vimaire, le capitaine Carotte et les hommes du Guet municipal... et les gens ordinaires comme Planteur Je-m'tranche-la-gorge, Ron l'Infect, les Igor... et la Mort. Le Disque-monde est peut-être né de l'imagination de son créateur, Terry Pratchett, mais, au fil de la trentaine de romans publiés, il a mené sa propre vie. Le présent ouvrage réunit pour la première fois les illustrations du voyage personnel de Paul Kidby sur le Disque, en couleurs éclatantes et en noir et blanc raffiné : un bouquet de personnages qui ont gagné le cœur de millions de lecteurs remplis d'admiration dans le monde entier.

       "143  Le Disque-monde navigue dans l'espace sur le dos de quatre éléphants posés sur une tortue géante (ils étaient autrefois cinq, mais c'est une autre histoire). C'est un monde débordant de magie, un monde de contrastes et d'extrêmes qui va de la métropole grouillante d'Ankh-Morpork, la plus ancienne ville du Disque (aujourd'hui administrée d'une main de fer dans un gant de velours par le Patricien, le seigneur Vétérini), jusqu'au vieil empire du Klatch où il existe quinze mots différents pour désigner l'assassinat. Sans oublier le mystérieux continent XXXX - ou Quatricks, sur lequel rien de ce qu'on a entendu dire n'est vraiment exagéré -, le tout petit royaume de Lancre et l'Uberwald, un pays sinistre ou des bruits de collision retentissent dans la nuit. Et puis il y a les habitants. Les sorcières Mémé Ciredutemps, Nounou Ogg, Magrat Goussedail (aujourd'hui reine, bien entendu). Une pléthore de mages, comme l'archichancelier Mustrum Ridculle, le bibliothécaire, Rincevent, l'économe... Les moines de l'histoire et les vieilles familles de vampyres. De grands héros, tels Cohen le barbare et sa Horde d'Argent, Sam Vimaire, le capitaine Carotte et les hommes du Guet municipal... et les gens ordinaires comme Planteur Je-m'tranche-la-gorge, Ron l'Infect, les Igor... et la Mort. Le Disque-monde est peut-être né de l'imagination de son créateur, Terry Pratchett, mais, au fil de la trentaine de romans publiés, il a mené sa propre vie. Le présent ouvrage réunit pour la première fois les illustrations du voyage personnel de Paul Kidby sur le Disque, en couleurs éclatantes et en noir et blanc raffiné : un bouquet de personnages qui ont gagné le cœur de millions de lecteurs remplis d'admiration dans le monde entier.

We all know him , or think we do : In recent works and in our inherited conventional wisdom , he remains fixed in place as a genial polymath and self-improver who was so very American that he is known by us all as the first American . The problem with this beloved notion of Franklin 's quintessential Americanness , Gordon Wood shows us in this marvelous , revelatory book , is that it 's simply not true . And it blinds us to the no less admirable or important but far more interesting man Franklin really was and leaves us powerless to make sense of the most crucial events of his life . Indeed , thinking of Franklin as the last American would be less of a hindrance to understanding many crucial aspects of his life -- his preoccupation with becoming a gentleman ; his longtime loyalty to the Crown and burning ambition to be a player in the British Empire 's power structure ; the personal character of his conversion to revolutionary ; his reasons for writing the Autobiography ; his controversies with John and Samuel Adams and with Congress ; his love of Europe and conflicted sense of national identity ; the fact that his death was greeted by mass mourning in France and widely ignored in America . But Franklin did become the Revolution 's necessary man , Wood shows , second behind George Washington . Why was his importance so denigrated in his own lifetime and his image so distorted ever since ? Ironically , Franklin 's diplomacy in France , which was essential to American victory , was the cause of the suspicion that clouded his good name at home -- and also the stage on which the `` first American '' persona made its debut . The consolidation of thismirage of Franklin would await the early nineteenth century , though , when the mask he created in his posthumously published Autobiography proved to be the model the citizens of a striving young democracy needed . The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin is a landmark work , a magnificent fresh vision of Franklin 's life and reputation , filled with profound insights into the Revolution and into the emergence of America 's idea of itself .</td>\n",

Her journey takes her far beyond the borders of the Land , across the sea and into the heart of the mysterious desert region of Sador . Here she discovers that she can not destroy the weaponmachines alone -- she needs the help of the Sadorians . But before her dark quest can begin , Elspeth must learn the truth of her dreams : she must understand why the Beforetimers destroyed their world . . . . &lt; br / &gt;</td>\n",

Many of the insights he shares in this audiobook come from living and relating with these vulnerable people . His insights are also based on two stories from the Gospels : Jesus ' temptation in the desert ( Matthew 4:1-11 ) and Peter 's call to be a shepherd ( John 21:15-19 ) . &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; Nouwen comments that one of Christ 's temptations in the desert was to be relevant—to turn stones into bread . In living with profoundly disabled persons , Nouwen found that none of the skills he had used as a minister in past situations had any relevance to this community . Ministry , says our spiritual guide , has nothing to do with relevance , power or popularity. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; In the Gospel of John , Jesus asks Peter , `` Do you love me ? '' Nouwen realized that his personal worth was not in what he &lt; i &gt; did &lt; /i &gt; but in the gift he could be to another . Ministry , according to Nouwen , involves reaching out to others with outstretched arms , always discerning where God is leading .</td>\n",

Continuously in print since it was first published in 1843 , Dickens 's immortal tale is still relevant today , sending a message that cuts through the materialistic trappings of the holiday season and gets to its heart and soul .

C'est un monde débordant de magie , un monde de contrastes et d'extrêmes qui va de la métropole grouillante d'Ankh-Morpork , la plus ancienne ville du Disque ( aujourd'hui administrée d'une main de fer dans un gant de velours par le Patricien , le seigneur Vétérini ) , jusqu'au vieil empire du Klatch où il existe quinze mots différents pour désigner l'assassinat . Sans oublier le mystérieux continent XXXX - ou Quatricks , sur lequel rien de ce qu'on a entendu dire n'est vraiment exagéré - , le tout petit royaume de Lancre et l'Uberwald , un pays sinistre ou des bruits de collision retentissent dans la nuit . Et puis il y a les habitants . Les sorcières Mémé Ciredutemps , Nounou Ogg , Magrat Goussedail ( aujourd'hui reine , bien entendu ) . Une pléthore de mages , comme l'archichancelier Mustrum Ridculle , le bibliothécaire , Rincevent , l'économe ... Les moines de l'histoire et les vieilles familles de vampyres . De grands héros , tels Cohen le barbare et sa Horde d'Argent , Sam Vimaire , le capitaine Carotte et les hommes du Guet municipal ... et les gens ordinaires comme Planteur Je-m'tranche-la-gorge , Ron l'Infect , les Igor ... et la Mort . Le Disque-monde est peut-être né de l'imagination de son créateur , Terry Pratchett , mais , au fil de la trentaine de romans publiés , il a mené sa propre vie . Le présent ouvrage réunit pour la première fois les illustrations du voyage personnel de Paul Kidby sur le Disque , en couleurs éclatantes et en noir et blanc raffiné : un bouquet de personnages qui ont gagné le cœur de millions de lecteurs remplis d'admiration dans le monde entier .

       "1411  Central to America 's idea of itself is the character of Benjamin Franklin . We all know him , or think we do : In recent works and in our inherited conventional wisdom , he remains fixed in place as a genial polymath and self-improver who was so very American that he is known by us all as the first American . The problem with this beloved notion of Franklin 's quintessential Americanness , Gordon Wood shows us in this marvelous , revelatory book , is that it 's simply not true . And it blinds us to the no less admirable or important but far more interesting man Franklin really was and leaves us powerless to make sense of the most crucial events of his life . Indeed , thinking of Franklin as the last American would be less of a hindrance to understanding many crucial aspects of his life -- his preoccupation with becoming a gentleman ; his longtime loyalty to the Crown and burning ambition to be a player in the British Empire 's power structure ; the personal character of his conversion to revolutionary ; his reasons for writing the Autobiography ; his controversies with John and Samuel Adams and with Congress ; his love of Europe and conflicted sense of national identity ; the fact that his death was greeted by mass mourning in France and widely ignored in America . But Franklin did become the Revolution 's necessary man , Wood shows , second behind George Washington . Why was his importance so denigrated in his own lifetime and his image so distorted ever since ? Ironically , Franklin 's diplomacy in France , which was essential to American victory , was the cause of the suspicion that clouded his good name at home -- and also the stage on which the `` first American '' persona made its debut . The consolidation of thismirage of Franklin would await the early nineteenth century , though , when the mask he created in his posthumously published Autobiography proved to be the model the citizens of a striving young democracy needed . The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin is a landmark work , a magnificent fresh vision of Franklin 's life and reputation , filled with profound insights into the Revolution and into the emergence of America 's idea of itself .   \n",

Many of the insights he shares in this audiobook come from living and relating with these vulnerable people . His insights are also based on two stories from the Gospels : Jesus ' temptation in the desert ( Matthew 4:1-11 ) and Peter 's call to be a shepherd ( John 21:15-19 ) . < br / > < br / > < br / > < br / > < br / > < br / > Nouwen comments that one of Christ 's temptations in the desert was to be relevant—to turn stones into bread . In living with profoundly disabled persons , Nouwen found that none of the skills he had used as a minister in past situations had any relevance to this community . Ministry , says our spiritual guide , has nothing to do with relevance , power or popularity. < br / > < br / > < br / > < br / > < br / > < br / > In the Gospel of John , Jesus asks Peter , `` Do you love me ?

One of the most famous characters in literary history , Ebenezer Scrooge is the `` grasping old sinner '' who finds redemption after witnessing scenes from his life in which his greed , self-interest , and lack of compassion are revealed. < br / > Complementing the master storyteller 's wise and witty prose are the timeless illustrations of Arthur Rackham , whose evocative artwork finds humor in Scrooge 's miserly ways , depicting him as a cranky humbug who eventually relents and joins the merrymaking . Continuously in print since it was first published in 1843 , Dickens 's immortal tale is still relevant today , sending a message that cuts through the materialistic trappings of the holiday season and gets to its heart and soul . This illustrated edition stands as one of the most beautiful available. < br / >   \n",

He embarks on an epic journey through a land of tribal superstition and modern prejudice where he will learn the power of words , the power to transform lives and the power of one .   \n",
