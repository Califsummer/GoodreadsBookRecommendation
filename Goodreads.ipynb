       "      <td>On 22 June 1941, Adolf Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Over 3,000,000 men, more than 3,000 tanks, and over 2,000 aircraft advanced east to begin National Socialism's crusade to destroy Bolshevism and carve out \"living space\" for the Thousand Year Reich. During the first few weeks of the invasion, the Germans achieved staggering results, as whole Soviet armies were annihilated, thousands of aircraft were destroyed on the ground, and hundreds of thousands of enemy soldiers were captured. Images of Barbarossa includes photographs of Operation Typhoon, the attempt by three panzer armies to capture Moscow. However, Soviet doggedness and one of the coldest Russian winters in living memory combined to stop the Germans at the gates of the Soviet capital, and in the process dashed any hopes of bringing the war on the Eastern Front to an end in 1942. Then, the Soviets unleashed a counter-attack along the front, under which the German armies buckled but managed to hold - just. Drawing on many previously unpublished images sourced from Russian archives, Christopher Ailsby recreates the experience of war on the Eastern Front in 1941: the choking dust and endless steppes of the Ukraine, the glutinous autumn and winter mud that made movement by wheeled and tracked vehicles all but impossible, and the numbing Russian Winter, which froze petrol and killed thousands of ill-equipped German soldiers. Away from the battlefield, Images of Barbarossa features the alrocities of the German SS and paramilitary units that followed the armies into the Soviet Union to implement the murderous racial policies of Nazism. Many of the images are haunting, and convey the horror and destructiveness of war on the Eastern Front.</td>\n",

       "2  On 22 June 1941, Adolf Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Over 3,000,000 men, more than 3,000 tanks, and over 2,000 aircraft advanced east to begin National Socialism's crusade to destroy Bolshevism and carve out \"living space\" for the Thousand Year Reich. During the first few weeks of the invasion, the Germans achieved staggering results, as whole Soviet armies were annihilated, thousands of aircraft were destroyed on the ground, and hundreds of thousands of enemy soldiers were captured. Images of Barbarossa includes photographs of Operation Typhoon, the attempt by three panzer armies to capture Moscow. However, Soviet doggedness and one of the coldest Russian winters in living memory combined to stop the Germans at the gates of the Soviet capital, and in the process dashed any hopes of bringing the war on the Eastern Front to an end in 1942. Then, the Soviets unleashed a counter-attack along the front, under which the German armies buckled but managed to hold - just. Drawing on many previously unpublished images sourced from Russian archives, Christopher Ailsby recreates the experience of war on the Eastern Front in 1941: the choking dust and endless steppes of the Ukraine, the glutinous autumn and winter mud that made movement by wheeled and tracked vehicles all but impossible, and the numbing Russian Winter, which froze petrol and killed thousands of ill-equipped German soldiers. Away from the battlefield, Images of Barbarossa features the alrocities of the German SS and paramilitary units that followed the armies into the Soviet Union to implement the murderous racial policies of Nazism. Many of the images are haunting, and convey the horror and destructiveness of war on the Eastern Front.   \n",

C'est un monde débordant de magie, un monde de contrastes et d'extrêmes qui va de la métropole grouillante d'Ankh-Morpork, la plus ancienne ville du Disque (aujourd'hui administrée d'une main de fer dans un gant de velours par le Patricien, le seigneur Vétérini), jusqu'au vieil empire du Klatch où il existe quinze mots différents pour désigner l'assassinat. Sans oublier le mystérieux continent XXXX - ou Quatricks, sur lequel rien de ce qu'on a entendu dire n'est vraiment exagéré -, le tout petit royaume de Lancre et l'Uberwald, un pays sinistre ou des bruits de collision retentissent dans la nuit. Et puis il y a les habitants. Les sorcières Mémé Ciredutemps, Nounou Ogg, Magrat Goussedail (aujourd'hui reine, bien entendu). Une pléthore de mages, comme l'archichancelier Mustrum Ridculle, le bibliothécaire, Rincevent, l'économe... Les moines de l'histoire et les vieilles familles de vampyres. De grands héros, tels Cohen le barbare et sa Horde d'Argent, Sam Vimaire, le capitaine Carotte et les hommes du Guet municipal... et les gens ordinaires comme Planteur Je-m'tranche-la-gorge, Ron l'Infect, les Igor... et la Mort. Le Disque-monde est peut-être né de l'imagination de son créateur, Terry Pratchett, mais, au fil de la trentaine de romans publiés, il a mené sa propre vie. Le présent ouvrage réunit pour la première fois les illustrations du voyage personnel de Paul Kidby sur le Disque, en couleurs éclatantes et en noir et blanc raffiné : un bouquet de personnages qui ont gagné le cœur de millions de lecteurs remplis d'admiration dans le monde entier.

When the king decides to choose a bride from among The Most Worthy and Beautiful Daughters in the Land, both Mufaro's girls travel to the capital city. But only one can be chosen to marry the king.Perfect for introducing variants to the Cinderella story as well as the history, culture, and geography of the African nation of Zimbabwe.   \n",
       "143  Le Disque-monde navigue dans l'espace sur le dos de quatre éléphants posés sur une tortue géante (ils étaient autrefois cinq, mais c'est une autre histoire). C'est un monde débordant de magie, un monde de contrastes et d'extrêmes qui va de la métropole grouillante d'Ankh-Morpork, la plus ancienne ville du Disque (aujourd'hui administrée d'une main de fer dans un gant de velours par le Patricien, le seigneur Vétérini), jusqu'au vieil empire du Klatch où il existe quinze mots différents pour désigner l'assassinat. Sans oublier le mystérieux continent XXXX - ou Quatricks, sur lequel rien de ce qu'on a entendu dire n'est vraiment exagéré -, le tout petit royaume de Lancre et l'Uberwald, un pays sinistre ou des bruits de collision retentissent dans la nuit. Et puis il y a les habitants. Les sorcières Mémé Ciredutemps, Nounou Ogg, Magrat Goussedail (aujourd'hui reine, bien entendu). Une pléthore de mages, comme l'archichancelier Mustrum Ridculle, le bibliothécaire, Rincevent, l'économe... Les moines de l'histoire et les vieilles familles de vampyres. De grands héros, tels Cohen le barbare et sa Horde d'Argent, Sam Vimaire, le capitaine Carotte et les hommes du Guet municipal... et les gens ordinaires comme Planteur Je-m'tranche-la-gorge, Ron l'Infect, les Igor... et la Mort. Le Disque-monde est peut-être né de l'imagination de son créateur, Terry Pratchett, mais, au fil de la trentaine de romans publiés, il a mené sa propre vie.

Sans oublier le mystérieux continent XXXX - ou Quatricks , sur lequel rien de ce qu'on a entendu dire n'est vraiment exagéré - , le tout petit royaume de Lancre et l'Uberwald , un pays sinistre ou des bruits de collision retentissent dans la nuit . Et puis il y a les habitants . Les sorcières Mémé Ciredutemps , Nounou Ogg , Magrat Goussedail ( aujourd'hui reine , bien entendu ) . Une pléthore de mages , comme l'archichancelier Mustrum Ridculle , le bibliothécaire , Rincevent , l'économe ... Les moines de l'histoire et les vieilles familles de vampyres . De grands héros , tels Cohen le barbare et sa Horde d'Argent , Sam Vimaire , le capitaine Carotte et les hommes du Guet municipal ... et les gens ordinaires comme Planteur Je-m'tranche-la-gorge , Ron l'Infect , les Igor ... et la Mort . Le Disque-monde est peut-être né de l'imagination de son créateur , Terry Pratchett , mais , au fil de la trentaine de romans publiés , il a mené sa propre vie . Le présent ouvrage réunit pour la première fois les illustrations du voyage personnel de Paul Kidby sur le Disque , en couleurs éclatantes et en noir et blanc raffiné : un bouquet de personnages qui ont gagné le cœur de millions de lecteurs remplis d'admiration dans le monde entier .

       "143    Le Disque-monde navigue dans l'espace sur le dos de quatre éléphants posés sur une tortue géante ( ils étaient autrefois cinq , mais c'est une autre histoire ) . C'est un monde débordant de magie , un monde de contrastes et d'extrêmes qui va de la métropole grouillante d'Ankh-Morpork , la plus ancienne ville du Disque ( aujourd'hui administrée d'une main de fer dans un gant de velours par le Patricien , le seigneur Vétérini ) , jusqu'au vieil empire du Klatch où il existe quinze mots différents pour désigner l'assassinat . Sans oublier le mystérieux continent XXXX - ou Quatricks , sur lequel rien de ce qu'on a entendu dire n'est vraiment exagéré - , le tout petit royaume de Lancre et l'Uberwald , un pays sinistre ou des bruits de collision retentissent dans la nuit . Et puis il y a les habitants . Les sorcières Mémé Ciredutemps , Nounou Ogg , Magrat Goussedail ( aujourd'hui reine , bien entendu ) . Une pléthore de mages , comme l'archichancelier Mustrum Ridculle , le bibliothécaire , Rincevent , l'économe ... Les moines de l'histoire et les vieilles familles de vampyres . De grands héros , tels Cohen le barbare et sa Horde d'Argent , Sam Vimaire , le capitaine Carotte et les hommes du Guet municipal ... et les gens ordinaires comme Planteur Je-m'tranche-la-gorge , Ron l'Infect , les Igor ... et la Mort . Le Disque-monde est peut-être né de l'imagination de son créateur , Terry Pratchett , mais , au fil de la trentaine de romans publiés , il a mené sa propre vie . Le présent ouvrage réunit pour la première fois les illustrations du voyage personnel de Paul Kidby sur le Disque , en couleurs éclatantes et en noir et blanc raffiné : un bouquet de personnages qui ont gagné le cœur de millions de lecteurs remplis d'admiration dans le monde entier . Voici `` L'art du Disque-monde `` .   \n",
