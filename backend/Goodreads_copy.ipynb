       "      <td>On 22 June 1941, Adolf Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Over 3,000,000 men, more than 3,000 tanks, and over 2,000 aircraft advanced east to begin National Socialism's crusade to destroy Bolshevism and carve out \"living space\" for the Thousand Year Reich. During the first few weeks of the invasion, the Germans achieved staggering results, as whole Soviet armies were annihilated, thousands of aircraft were destroyed on the ground, and hundreds of thousands of enemy soldiers were captured. Images of Barbarossa includes photographs of Operation Typhoon, the attempt by three panzer armies to capture Moscow. However, Soviet doggedness and one of the coldest Russian winters in living memory combined to stop the Germans at the gates of the Soviet capital, and in the process dashed any hopes of bringing the war on the Eastern Front to an end in 1942. Then, the Soviets unleashed a counter-attack along the front, under which the German armies buckled but managed to hold - just. Drawing on many previously unpublished images sourced from Russian archives, Christopher Ailsby recreates the experience of war on the Eastern Front in 1941: the choking dust and endless steppes of the Ukraine, the glutinous autumn and winter mud that made movement by wheeled and tracked vehicles all but impossible, and the numbing Russian Winter, which froze petrol and killed thousands of ill-equipped German soldiers. Away from the battlefield, Images of Barbarossa features the alrocities of the German SS and paramilitary units that followed the armies into the Soviet Union to implement the murderous racial policies of Nazism. Many of the images are haunting, and convey the horror and destructiveness of war on the Eastern Front.</td>\n",

       "2  On 22 June 1941, Adolf Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Over 3,000,000 men, more than 3,000 tanks, and over 2,000 aircraft advanced east to begin National Socialism's crusade to destroy Bolshevism and carve out \"living space\" for the Thousand Year Reich. During the first few weeks of the invasion, the Germans achieved staggering results, as whole Soviet armies were annihilated, thousands of aircraft were destroyed on the ground, and hundreds of thousands of enemy soldiers were captured. Images of Barbarossa includes photographs of Operation Typhoon, the attempt by three panzer armies to capture Moscow. However, Soviet doggedness and one of the coldest Russian winters in living memory combined to stop the Germans at the gates of the Soviet capital, and in the process dashed any hopes of bringing the war on the Eastern Front to an end in 1942. Then, the Soviets unleashed a counter-attack along the front, under which the German armies buckled but managed to hold - just. Drawing on many previously unpublished images sourced from Russian archives, Christopher Ailsby recreates the experience of war on the Eastern Front in 1941: the choking dust and endless steppes of the Ukraine, the glutinous autumn and winter mud that made movement by wheeled and tracked vehicles all but impossible, and the numbing Russian Winter, which froze petrol and killed thousands of ill-equipped German soldiers. Away from the battlefield, Images of Barbarossa features the alrocities of the German SS and paramilitary units that followed the armies into the Soviet Union to implement the murderous racial policies of Nazism. Many of the images are haunting, and convey the horror and destructiveness of war on the Eastern Front.   \n",

Divided into chapters such as \"Bad Girls' Bed-Time Stories\" and \"Barbed-Wire Silences,\" Stanescu's poems are sharp, sensual looks into everyday life. \"Saviana Stanescu is for and of the 21st century. She is hot and cool, witty and brave, sexy and weird, politically knowing and cynical. But most of all, she is an extraordinary writer\"-- Richard Schechner.   \n",

C'est un monde débordant de magie, un monde de contrastes et d'extrêmes qui va de la métropole grouillante d'Ankh-Morpork, la plus ancienne ville du Disque (aujourd'hui administrée d'une main de fer dans un gant de velours par le Patricien, le seigneur Vétérini), jusqu'au vieil empire du Klatch où il existe quinze mots différents pour désigner l'assassinat. Sans oublier le mystérieux continent XXXX - ou Quatricks, sur lequel rien de ce qu'on a entendu dire n'est vraiment exagéré -, le tout petit royaume de Lancre et l'Uberwald, un pays sinistre ou des bruits de collision retentissent dans la nuit. Et puis il y a les habitants. Les sorcières Mémé Ciredutemps, Nounou Ogg, Magrat Goussedail (aujourd'hui reine, bien entendu). Une pléthore de mages, comme l'archichancelier Mustrum Ridculle, le bibliothécaire, Rincevent, l'économe... Les moines de l'histoire et les vieilles familles de vampyres. De grands héros, tels Cohen le barbare et sa Horde d'Argent, Sam Vimaire, le capitaine Carotte et les hommes du Guet municipal... et les gens ordinaires comme Planteur Je-m'tranche-la-gorge, Ron l'Infect, les Igor... et la Mort. Le Disque-monde est peut-être né de l'imagination de son créateur, Terry Pratchett, mais, au fil de la trentaine de romans publiés, il a mené sa propre vie. Le présent ouvrage réunit pour la première fois les illustrations du voyage personnel de Paul Kidby sur le Disque, en couleurs éclatantes et en noir et blanc raffiné : un bouquet de personnages qui ont gagné le cœur de millions de lecteurs remplis d'admiration dans le monde entier.

It is old and little, and altogether delightful-red brick. We can scarcely pack in as it is, and the dear knows what will happen when Paul (younger son) arrives to-morrow. From hall you go right or left into dining-room or drawing-room. Hall itself is practically a room. You open another door in it, and there are the stairs going up in a sort of tunnel to the first-floor. Three bed-rooms in a row there, and three attics in a row above. That isn't all the house really, but it's all that one notices-nine windows as you look up from the front garden. \"Then there's a very big wych-elm-to the left as you look up-leaning a little over the house, and standing on the boundary between the garden and meadow. I quite love that tree already. Also ordinary elms, oaks-no nastier than ordinary oaks- pear-trees, apple-trees, and a vine. No silver birches, though. However, I must get on to my host and hostess. I only wanted to show that it isn't the least what we expected. Why did we settle that their house would be all gables and wiggles, and their garden all gamboge-coloured paths? I believe simply because we associate them with expensive hotels-Mrs. Wilcox trailing in beautiful dresses down long corridors, Mr. Wilcox bullying porters, etc. We females are that unjust.

It is old and little, and altogether delightful-red brick. We can scarcely pack in as it is, and the dear knows what will happen when Paul (younger son) arrives to-morrow. From hall you go right or left into dining-room or drawing-room. Hall itself is practically a room. You open another door in it, and there are the stairs going up in a sort of tunnel to the first-floor. Three bed-rooms in a row there, and three attics in a row above. That isn't all the house really, but it's all that one notices-nine windows as you look up from the front garden. \"Then there's a very big wych-elm-to the left as you look up-leaning a little over the house, and standing on the boundary between the garden and meadow. I quite love that tree already. Also ordinary elms, oaks-no nastier than ordinary oaks- pear-trees, apple-trees, and a vine. No silver birches, though. However, I must get on to my host and hostess. I only wanted to show that it isn't the least what we expected. Why did we settle that their house would be all gables and wiggles, and their garden all gamboge-coloured paths? I believe simply because we associate them with expensive hotels-Mrs. Wilcox trailing in beautiful dresses down long corridors, Mr. Wilcox bullying porters, etc. We females are that unjust.

Nyasha is kind and considerate, but Manyara is selfish and spoiled. When the king decides to choose a bride from among The Most Worthy and Beautiful Daughters in the Land, both Mufaro's girls travel to the capital city. But only one can be chosen to marry the king.Perfect for introducing variants to the Cinderella story as well as the history, culture, and geography of the African nation of Zimbabwe.   \n",
       "143  Le Disque-monde navigue dans l'espace sur le dos de quatre éléphants posés sur une tortue géante (ils étaient autrefois cinq, mais c'est une autre histoire). C'est un monde débordant de magie, un monde de contrastes et d'extrêmes qui va de la métropole grouillante d'Ankh-Morpork, la plus ancienne ville du Disque (aujourd'hui administrée d'une main de fer dans un gant de velours par le Patricien, le seigneur Vétérini), jusqu'au vieil empire du Klatch où il existe quinze mots différents pour désigner l'assassinat. Sans oublier le mystérieux continent XXXX - ou Quatricks, sur lequel rien de ce qu'on a entendu dire n'est vraiment exagéré -, le tout petit royaume de Lancre et l'Uberwald, un pays sinistre ou des bruits de collision retentissent dans la nuit. Et puis il y a les habitants. Les sorcières Mémé Ciredutemps, Nounou Ogg, Magrat Goussedail (aujourd'hui reine, bien entendu). Une pléthore de mages, comme l'archichancelier Mustrum Ridculle, le bibliothécaire, Rincevent, l'économe... Les moines de l'histoire et les vieilles familles de vampyres. De grands héros, tels Cohen le barbare et sa Horde d'Argent, Sam Vimaire, le capitaine Carotte et les hommes du Guet municipal... et les gens ordinaires comme Planteur Je-m'tranche-la-gorge, Ron l'Infect, les Igor... et la Mort. Le Disque-monde est peut-être né de l'imagination de son créateur, Terry Pratchett, mais, au fil de la trentaine de romans publiés, il a mené sa propre vie. Le présent ouvrage réunit pour la première fois les illustrations du voyage personnel de Paul Kidby sur le Disque, en couleurs éclatantes et en noir et blanc raffiné : un bouquet de personnages qui ont gagné le cœur de millions de lecteurs remplis d'admiration dans le monde entier.

C'est un monde débordant de magie , un monde de contrastes et d'extrêmes qui va de la métropole grouillante d'Ankh-Morpork , la plus ancienne ville du Disque ( aujourd'hui administrée d'une main de fer dans un gant de velours par le Patricien , le seigneur Vétérini ) , jusqu'au vieil empire du Klatch où il existe quinze mots différents pour désigner l'assassinat . Sans oublier le mystérieux continent XXXX - ou Quatricks , sur lequel rien de ce qu'on a entendu dire n'est vraiment exagéré - , le tout petit royaume de Lancre et l'Uberwald , un pays sinistre ou des bruits de collision retentissent dans la nuit . Et puis il y a les habitants . Les sorcières Mémé Ciredutemps , Nounou Ogg , Magrat Goussedail ( aujourd'hui reine , bien entendu ) . Une pléthore de mages , comme l'archichancelier Mustrum Ridculle , le bibliothécaire , Rincevent , l'économe ... Les moines de l'histoire et les vieilles familles de vampyres . De grands héros , tels Cohen le barbare et sa Horde d'Argent , Sam Vimaire , le capitaine Carotte et les hommes du Guet municipal ... et les gens ordinaires comme Planteur Je-m'tranche-la-gorge , Ron l'Infect , les Igor ... et la Mort . Le Disque-monde est peut-être né de l'imagination de son créateur , Terry Pratchett , mais , au fil de la trentaine de romans publiés , il a mené sa propre vie . Le présent ouvrage réunit pour la première fois les illustrations du voyage personnel de Paul Kidby sur le Disque , en couleurs éclatantes et en noir et blanc raffiné : un bouquet de personnages qui ont gagné le cœur de millions de lecteurs remplis d'admiration dans le monde entier .

It is old and little , and altogether delightful-red brick . We can scarcely pack in as it is , and the dear knows what will happen when Paul ( younger son ) arrives to-morrow . From hall you go right or left into dining-room or drawing-room . Hall itself is practically a room . You open another door in it , and there are the stairs going up in a sort of tunnel to the first-floor . Three bed-rooms in a row there , and three attics in a row above . That is n't all the house really , but it 's all that one notices-nine windows as you look up from the front garden . `` Then there 's a very big wych-elm-to the left as you look up-leaning a little over the house , and standing on the boundary between the garden and meadow . I quite love that tree already . Also ordinary elms , oaks-no nastier than ordinary oaks- pear-trees , apple-trees , and a vine . No silver birches , though . However , I must get on to my host and hostess . I only wanted to show that it is n't the least what we expected . Why did we settle that their house would be all gables and wiggles , and their garden all gamboge-coloured paths ? I believe simply because we associate them with expensive hotels-Mrs. Wilcox trailing in beautiful dresses down long corridors , Mr. Wilcox bullying porters , etc . We females are that unjust .

       "      <td>Tintin , Captain Haddock and Calculus are on their way to Sydney for an international conference on space exploration . While their flight makes a refueling stop in Jakarta 's Kemayoran Airport , they unexpectedly meet their old friend Piotr Skut , who is now the chief pilot for eccentric millionaire Laszlo Carreidas . A short time earlier , the Captain had erroneously taken the somewhat disheveled Carreidas for a tramp and surreptitiously slipped him a five-dollar bill ( which later is taken by the oblivious Professor Calculus , making the millionaire laugh for the first time in years ) . When introduced to Carreidas , the Captain inadvertently shakes the hand of the millionaire 's secretary , the tall , aloof Spalding. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; Unable to politely refuse Carreidas 's offer of a ride on his prototype private jet , Tintin and his friends join the millionaire on the way to Sydney . Carreidas plays Battleship with the Captain , defeating him repeatedly by cheating with a hidden closed-circuit television camera and monitor . Unbeknownst to Carreidas and the others , Spalding and two of the pilots , Boehm and Colombani , have been recruited to hijack the plane and bring it to a deserted island called Pulau-Pulau Bompa in the Celebes Sea . Skut is not involved in the plot , and so he becomes a prisoner too . After a rough landing , our friends are escorted out of the plane , and a terrified Snowy breaks out of Tintin 's arms and runs off . Armed guards shoot at him , and a mortified Tintin takes him for dead. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; A moment or two later , to Tintin 's further shock , it turns out that the mastermind of the plot is none other than the evil Rastapopoulos , who declares that since `` it 's a bore to stop being a millionaire , '' it would be easier to simply take Carreidas 's fortune . Accordingly , he has hatched an elaborate scheme to kidnap Carreidas and extract his Swiss bank account number . Captain Haddock 's corrupt old nemesis , Allan , is working as Rastapopoulos 's henchman . As for Tintin , the Captain and Calculus , Rastapopulos actually had no idea they would be accompanying the crotchety millionaire , but is nonetheless delighted to have the opportunity to exact revenge , and makes it quite evident that a very grim fate awaits our friends. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; Everyone is bound and held in Japanese World War II-era bunkers. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; Meanwhile , Rastapopoulos takes a defiant Carreidas to another World War II-era bunker and has him strapped to a chair , to be subjected to the tender mercies of the malevolent Dr. Krollspell . The corrupt doctor injects the millionaire with truth serum , so as to enable Rastapopulos to pry Carreidas 's Swiss bank account number out of him . Unfortunately for Rastapopoulos , this plan quickly flounders . For Carreidas proves more than willing to tell the truth -- about everything except the Swiss bank account . To Rastapopulos 's fury , Carreidas launches into long disquisitions about his greedy , unscrupulous nature , boasting how he first stole a pear in 1910 , at the age of four ; shamed both his grandfather and his great-aunt to death ; and has generally led a life of perfidy and corruption . Realizing the serum is defective , Rastapopulos becomes enraged , lunges at Krollspell ( who is still holding the truth-drug syringe ) , and is accidentally injected with the serum , becoming intoxicated . He too recounts hideous deeds in a boasting manner , calling himself `` the devil incarnate '' . From what Rastapopoulos says under the serum 's influence , Krollspell realizes that the crime boss intends not to reward him as promised , but to betray and murder him. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; With the help of Snowy , who is not dead after all , Tintin and his friends manage to escape the bunker in which they are being imprisoned and find the bunker , high on the volcano , where Carreidas is held prisoner . Tintin captures Krollspell and Rastapopulos and escorts them to lower ground , intending to use them as hostages . However , the serum wears off and Rastapopulos escapes , despite Krollspell 's warnings ; the doctor is released afterwards and continues to accompany Tintin and Haddock , watching the still irritable Carreidas. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; Later , they discover , thanks to a `` voice '' Tintin is hearing , a hidden entrance to a statue-filled cave . Knowing that they are in danger , as Rastapopulos is gathering his armed guards to pursue and kill them , they decide to enter the cave and they discover a large hallway , leading to the inside of the volcano . They enter the volcano 's core by triggering a hidden mechanism . Rastapopulos and his cohorts are not far behind , but they fail to find out how to open the secret passage . Instead they use explosives to make their own entrance. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; Penetrating deeper into the volcano , Tintin and his friends meet a strange man , Mik Kanrokitoff , a writer for magazine Space Week , who wears a transmitter on his ear and speaks with a heavy Russian accent ( he is the voice that has guided Tintin to the cave ) . He immediately notes that they are all in great danger , because the explosion triggered by Rastapopoulos has made the volcano unstable and it will soon erupt . They follow Kanrokitoff , who has the power to influence their minds , as he knows exactly where to escape . It becomes hotter as they find their way out of the core of the volcano , and at one point a large flow of lava threatens them , but they find a pathway up that leads to an exit . Fleeing the lava flow , Carreidas pushes Haddock off the stairs , but fortunately Haddock grabs onto a stalagmite , narrowly escaping imminent death . The strange Kanrokitoff uses his mind trick to calm the impetuous Carreidas down . Meanwhile , Rastapopoulos and his henchmen flee the eruption by running down the outside of the volcano and plan to take refuge in a rubber dinghy. &lt; br / &gt; &lt; br / &gt; Once Tintin and his friends find their way out of the volcano , Kanrokitoff puts them all under his hypnosis . He uses his transmitter , and apparent psychic powers , to summon a flying saucer , piloted by unseen aliens with whom he is apparently familiar . The hypnotised group climb up a retractable ladder and board the saucer , narrowly escaping the volcano 's dramatic eruption . Kanrokitoff spots the rubber dinghy and exchanges Tintin and his companions for Allan , Spalding , Rastapopulos and the treacherous pilots , who are whisked away in the saucer . The group - including Krollspell , who is later deposited by the saucer at his institute in Cairo - awakes from hypnosis and can not remember what happened to them . The party is eventually rescued , but only Snowy , who can not speak , has any recollection of the hijacking and alien abduction .</td>\n",

       "      <td>Central to America 's idea of itself is the character of Benjamin Franklin . We all know him , or think we do : In recent works and in our inherited conventional wisdom , he remains fixed in place as a genial polymath and self-improver who was so very American that he is known by us all as the first American . The problem with this beloved notion of Franklin 's quintessential Americanness , Gordon Wood shows us in this marvelous , revelatory book , is that it 's simply not true . And it blinds us to the no less admirable or important but far more interesting man Franklin really was and leaves us powerless to make sense of the most crucial events of his life . Indeed , thinking of Franklin as the last American would be less of a hindrance to understanding many crucial aspects of his life -- his preoccupation with becoming a gentleman ; his longtime loyalty to the Crown and burning ambition to be a player in the British Empire 's power structure ; the personal character of his conversion to revolutionary ; his reasons for writing the Autobiography ; his controversies with John and Samuel Adams and with Congress ; his love of Europe and conflicted sense of national identity ; the fact that his death was greeted by mass mourning in France and widely ignored in America . But Franklin did become the Revolution 's necessary man , Wood shows , second behind George Washington . Why was his importance so denigrated in his own lifetime and his image so distorted ever since ? Ironically , Franklin 's diplomacy in France , which was essential to American victory , was the cause of the suspicion that clouded his good name at home -- and also the stage on which the `` first American '' persona made its debut . The consolidation of thismirage of Franklin would await the early nineteenth century , though , when the mask he created in his posthumously published Autobiography proved to be the model the citizens of a striving young democracy needed . The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin is a landmark work , a magnificent fresh vision of Franklin 's life and reputation , filled with profound insights into the Revolution and into the emergence of America 's idea of itself .</td>\n",

Disque-monde navigue dans l'espace sur le dos de quatre éléphants posés sur une tortue géante ( ils étaient autrefois cinq , mais c'est une autre histoire ) . C'est un monde débordant de magie , un monde de contrastes et d'extrêmes qui va de la métropole grouillante d'Ankh-Morpork , la plus ancienne ville du Disque ( aujourd'hui administrée d'une main de fer dans un gant de velours par le Patricien , le seigneur Vétérini ) , jusqu'au vieil empire du Klatch où il existe quinze mots différents pour désigner l'assassinat . Sans oublier le mystérieux continent XXXX - ou Quatricks , sur lequel rien de ce qu'on a entendu dire n'est vraiment exagéré - , le tout petit royaume de Lancre et l'Uberwald , un pays sinistre ou des bruits de collision retentissent dans la nuit . Et puis il y a les habitants . Les sorcières Mémé Ciredutemps , Nounou Ogg , Magrat Goussedail ( aujourd'hui reine , bien entendu ) . Une pléthore de mages , comme l'archichancelier Mustrum Ridculle , le bibliothécaire , Rincevent , l'économe ... Les moines de l'histoire et les vieilles familles de vampyres . De grands héros , tels Cohen le barbare et sa Horde d'Argent , Sam Vimaire , le capitaine Carotte et les hommes du Guet municipal ... et les gens ordinaires comme Planteur Je-m'tranche-la-gorge , Ron l'Infect , les Igor ... et la Mort . Le Disque-monde est peut-être né de l'imagination de son créateur , Terry Pratchett , mais , au fil de la trentaine de romans publiés , il a mené sa propre vie . Le présent ouvrage réunit pour la première fois les illustrations du voyage personnel de Paul Kidby sur le Disque , en couleurs éclatantes et en noir et blanc raffiné : un bouquet de personnages qui ont gagné le cœur de millions de lecteurs remplis d'admiration dans le monde entier .

Howards End , `` Tuesday . `` Dearest Meg , `` It is n't going to be what we expected . It is old and little , and altogether delightful-red brick . We can scarcely pack in as it is , and the dear knows what will happen when Paul ( younger son ) arrives to-morrow . From hall you go right or left into dining-room or drawing-room . Hall itself is practically a room . You open another door in it , and there are the stairs going up in a sort of tunnel to the first-floor . Three bed-rooms in a row there , and three attics in a row above . That is n't all the house really , but it 's all that one notices-nine windows as you look up from the front garden . `` Then there 's a very big wych-elm-to the left as you look up-leaning a little over the house , and standing on the boundary between the garden and meadow . I quite love that tree already . Also ordinary elms , oaks-no nastier than ordinary oaks- pear-trees , apple-trees , and a vine . No silver birches , though . However , I must get on to my host and hostess . I only wanted to show that it is n't the least what we expected . Why did we settle that their house would be all gables and wiggles , and their garden all gamboge-coloured paths ? I believe simply because we associate them with expensive hotels-Mrs. Wilcox trailing in beautiful dresses down long corridors , Mr. Wilcox bullying porters , etc . We females are that unjust .

I shall merely attempt to record what I see , what I think - more precisely , what we think ( exactly that : we , and let that < i > WE < /i > be the title of my records ) . < /b > < br / > < br / > Inside its glass dome the One State is a place of mathematical precision , a community where everything is everyone 's , and integrity , clarity , and unerring loyalty reign over all . Δ-503 , Constructor of the Integral , is an honest number , ashamed of the hairy hands that link him to a barbaric ancestry . It is this forbidden legacy that torments him by making him lust , that allows him to imagine , that has given him a soul . Consumed by his sickness and obsessed with the seductive and mysterious I-330 , Δ-503 is led by his new lover outside the Wall , where he colludes in a plot to overthrow the Benefactor . As the Benefactor retaliates by ordering a state-administered Operation to return order to the perfect world , Δ-503 find himself fighting for the primitive and natural state of chaos - and rebelling against what he once held true. < br / > < br / > A key work in the history of dystopian literature , Zamyatin 's < i > We < /i > was hugely influential , shaping the writing of many other authors including Orwell and Huxley . Written in the 1920s , and banned in the Soviet Union for over sixty years , < i > We < /i > is still topical today , a portent of future totalitarian regimes , and an admonition that the battle for freedom is never over .   \n",

Of course , I thought that yesterday , too , and it rained ... '' < /blockquote > < br / > Woody Allen 's humour defies categorisation . Forever at war with just about everything ( himself , women , dentists , the universe ... ) , he plays the role of the all-time loser with riotous aplomb. < br / > < br / > This book is Woody Allen 's guide to coping with what life has to offer - from finding excuses for psychic phenomena to the mysteries of Mensa , from God ( or lack of God ) to a brief , yet helpful , guide to civil disobedience . This is Woody Allen at his hilarious best - a genius in the tradition of Groucho Marx and James Thurber . A man whose simple artistic ambition is `` to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race . And then to see if I can get them mass-produced in plastic '' .   \n",

       "882   Tintin , Captain Haddock and Calculus are on their way to Sydney for an international conference on space exploration . While their flight makes a refueling stop in Jakarta 's Kemayoran Airport , they unexpectedly meet their old friend Piotr Skut , who is now the chief pilot for eccentric millionaire Laszlo Carreidas . A short time earlier , the Captain had erroneously taken the somewhat disheveled Carreidas for a tramp and surreptitiously slipped him a five-dollar bill ( which later is taken by the oblivious Professor Calculus , making the millionaire laugh for the first time in years ) . When introduced to Carreidas , the Captain inadvertently shakes the hand of the millionaire 's secretary , the tall , aloof Spalding. < br / > < br / > Unable to politely refuse Carreidas 's offer of a ride on his prototype private jet , Tintin and his friends join the millionaire on the way to Sydney . Carreidas plays Battleship with the Captain , defeating him repeatedly by cheating with a hidden closed-circuit television camera and monitor . Unbeknownst to Carreidas and the others , Spalding and two of the pilots , Boehm and Colombani , have been recruited to hijack the plane and bring it to a deserted island called Pulau-Pulau Bompa in the Celebes Sea . Skut is not involved in the plot , and so he becomes a prisoner too . After a rough landing , our friends are escorted out of the plane , and a terrified Snowy breaks out of Tintin 's arms and runs off . Armed guards shoot at him , and a mortified Tintin takes him for dead. < br / > < br / > A moment or two later , to Tintin 's further shock , it turns out that the mastermind of the plot is none other than the evil Rastapopoulos , who declares that since `` it 's a bore to stop being a millionaire , '' it would be easier to simply take Carreidas 's fortune . Accordingly , he has hatched an elaborate scheme to kidnap Carreidas and extract his Swiss bank account number . Captain Haddock 's corrupt old nemesis , Allan , is working as Rastapopoulos 's henchman . As for Tintin , the Captain and Calculus , Rastapopulos actually had no idea they would be accompanying the crotchety millionaire , but is nonetheless delighted to have the opportunity to exact revenge , and makes it quite evident that a very grim fate awaits our friends. < br / > < br / > Everyone is bound and held in Japanese World War II-era bunkers. < br / > < br / > Meanwhile , Rastapopoulos takes a defiant Carreidas to another World War II-era bunker and has him strapped to a chair , to be subjected to the tender mercies of the malevolent Dr. Krollspell . The corrupt doctor injects the millionaire with truth serum , so as to enable Rastapopulos to pry Carreidas 's Swiss bank account number out of him . Unfortunately for Rastapopoulos , this plan quickly flounders . For Carreidas proves more than willing to tell the truth -- about everything except the Swiss bank account . To Rastapopulos 's fury , Carreidas launches into long disquisitions about his greedy , unscrupulous nature , boasting how he first stole a pear in 1910 , at the age of four ; shamed both his grandfather and his great-aunt to death ; and has generally led a life of perfidy and corruption . Realizing the serum is defective , Rastapopulos becomes enraged , lunges at Krollspell ( who is still holding the truth-drug syringe ) , and is accidentally injected with the serum , becoming intoxicated . He too recounts hideous deeds in a boasting manner , calling himself `` the devil incarnate '' . From what Rastapopoulos says under the serum 's influence , Krollspell realizes that the crime boss intends not to reward him as promised , but to betray and murder him. < br / > < br / > With the help of Snowy , who is not dead after all , Tintin and his friends manage to escape the bunker in which they are being imprisoned and find the bunker , high on the volcano , where Carreidas is held prisoner . Tintin captures Krollspell and Rastapopulos and escorts them to lower ground , intending to use them as hostages . However , the serum wears off and Rastapopulos escapes , despite Krollspell 's warnings ; the doctor is released afterwards and continues to accompany Tintin and Haddock , watching the still irritable Carreidas. < br / > < br / > Later , they discover , thanks to a `` voice '' Tintin is hearing , a hidden entrance to a statue-filled cave . Knowing that they are in danger , as Rastapopulos is gathering his armed guards to pursue and kill them , they decide to enter the cave and they discover a large hallway , leading to the inside of the volcano . They enter the volcano 's core by triggering a hidden mechanism . Rastapopulos and his cohorts are not far behind , but they fail to find out how to open the secret passage . Instead they use explosives to make their own entrance. < br / > < br / > Penetrating deeper into the volcano , Tintin and his friends meet a strange man , Mik Kanrokitoff , a writer for magazine Space Week , who wears a transmitter on his ear and speaks with a heavy Russian accent ( he is the voice that has guided Tintin to the cave ) . He immediately notes that they are all in great danger , because the explosion triggered by Rastapopoulos has made the volcano unstable and it will soon erupt . They follow Kanrokitoff , who has the power to influence their minds , as he knows exactly where to escape . It becomes hotter as they find their way out of the core of the volcano , and at one point a large flow of lava threatens them , but they find a pathway up that leads to an exit . Fleeing the lava flow , Carreidas pushes Haddock off the stairs , but fortunately Haddock grabs onto a stalagmite , narrowly escaping imminent death . The strange Kanrokitoff uses his mind trick to calm the impetuous Carreidas down . Meanwhile , Rastapopoulos and his henchmen flee the eruption by running down the outside of the volcano and plan to take refuge in a rubber dinghy. < br / > < br / > Once Tintin and his friends find their way out of the volcano , Kanrokitoff puts them all under his hypnosis . He uses his transmitter , and apparent psychic powers , to summon a flying saucer , piloted by unseen aliens with whom he is apparently familiar . The hypnotised group climb up a retractable ladder and board the saucer , narrowly escaping the volcano 's dramatic eruption . Kanrokitoff spots the rubber dinghy and exchanges Tintin and his companions for Allan , Spalding , Rastapopulos and the treacherous pilots , who are whisked away in the saucer . The group - including Krollspell , who is later deposited by the saucer at his institute in Cairo - awakes from hypnosis and can not remember what happened to them . The party is eventually rescued , but only Snowy , who can not speak , has any recollection of the hijacking and alien abduction .   \n",

                                                        Kirsten has a hard time in her new American school because she does n't speak English very well . Miss Winston , her new teacher , is strict & amp ; not very understanding . Things get worse when Miss Winston comes to live with the Larson family . Kirsten 's only escape is playing with her secret friend Singing Bird , the Indian girl . When Singing Bird suggests running away forever , Kirsten must decide where she belongs . Kirsten does learn some important lessons in school , but she learns something even more important about herself .   \n",

We all know him , or think we do : In recent works and in our inherited conventional wisdom , he remains fixed in place as a genial polymath and self-improver who was so very American that he is known by us all as the first American . The problem with this beloved notion of Franklin 's quintessential Americanness , Gordon Wood shows us in this marvelous , revelatory book , is that it 's simply not true . And it blinds us to the no less admirable or important but far more interesting man Franklin really was and leaves us powerless to make sense of the most crucial events of his life . Indeed , thinking of Franklin as the last American would be less of a hindrance to understanding many crucial aspects of his life -- his preoccupation with becoming a gentleman ; his longtime loyalty to the Crown and burning ambition to be a player in the British Empire 's power structure ; the personal character of his conversion to revolutionary ; his reasons for writing the Autobiography ; his controversies with John and Samuel Adams and with Congress ; his love of Europe and conflicted sense of national identity ; the fact that his death was greeted by mass mourning in France and widely ignored in America . But Franklin did become the Revolution 's necessary man , Wood shows , second behind George Washington . Why was his importance so denigrated in his own lifetime and his image so distorted ever since ? Ironically , Franklin 's diplomacy in France , which was essential to American victory , was the cause of the suspicion that clouded his good name at home -- and also the stage on which the `` first American '' persona made its debut . The consolidation of thismirage of Franklin would await the early nineteenth century , though , when the mask he created in his posthumously published Autobiography proved to be the model the citizens of a striving young democracy needed . The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin is a landmark work , a magnificent fresh vision of Franklin 's life and reputation , filled with profound insights into the Revolution and into the emergence of America 's idea of itself .   \n",

                               The desert planet Arrakis , called Dune , has been destroyed . Now the Bene Gesserit , heirs to Dune 's powers , have colonized a green world and are turning it into a desert , mile by scorched mile . In this , the final book in the Dune Chronicles , Herbert again creates a world of breathtakingly evolved characters and the contexts in which to appreciate them . The richness of detail and perspective fascinates , while the multi-layered plot evolves as pages turn . Riveting from end to end , the legend lives on in the greatest science fiction epic of all time .   \n",

la libération du camp , un adolescent a vécu le cauchemat d'un temps arrêté et répétitif , victime tant de l'horreur concentrationnaire que de l'instinct de survie qui lui fit composer avec l'innaceptable .

Shadows . Amber burns in Corwin 's blood . Exiled on Shadow Earth for centuries , the prince is about to return to Amber to make a mad and desperate rush upon the throne . From Arden to the blood-slippery Stairway into the Sea , the air is electrified with the powers of Eric , Random , Bleys , Caine , and all the princes of Amber whom Corwin must overcome . Yet , his savage path is blocked and guarded by eerie structures beyond imagining ; impossible realities forged by demonic assassins and staggering horrors to challenge the might of Corwin 's superhuman fury . ' to 'Awakening in an Earth hospital unable to remember who he is or where he came from , Corwin is amazed to learn that he is one of the sons of Oberon , King of Amber , and is the rightful successor to the crown in a parallel world .   \n",

   If Danny Cartwright had proposed to Beth Wilson the day before , or the day after , he would not have been arrested and charged with the murder of his best friend. < br / > < br / > And when the four prosecution witnesses are a barrister , a popular actor , an aristocrat and the youngest partner in an established firm 's history , who is going to believe his side of the story ? < br / > < br / > Danny is sentenced to twenty-two years and sent to Belmarsh prison , the highest security jail in the land , from where no inmate has ever escaped. < br / > < br / > But Spencer Craig , Lawrence Davenport , Gerald Payne and Toby Mortimer all underestimate Danny 's determination to seek revenge and Beth 's relentless quest to win justice , which forces all protagonists to fight for their lives
